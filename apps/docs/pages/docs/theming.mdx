# Theming

Next Admin comes with a default theme which currently consists of Tailwind's indigo color as a primary color.

To use the default theme, you can import the generated CSS file from Next Admin:

```js
import "@premieroctet/next-admin/dist/styles.css";
```

However, you might want to override this primary color. It is possible to do so in your own Tailwind config file:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    ...yourFiles,
    "./node_modules/@premieroctet/next-admin/dist/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        nextadmin: {
          primary: {
            50: "#f3f4f6",
            100: "#e7e9ed",
            200: "#c7cdd6",
            300: "#a7b1bf",
            400: "#67788f",
            500: "#27445f",
            600: "#24405a",
            700: "#1c334b",
            800: "#172940",
            900: "#0f1d2e",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

You will then need to import your own generated CSS file instead of the Next Admin's one.
