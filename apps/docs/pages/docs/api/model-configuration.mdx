# Model configuration

<Callout type="info">
  This is the documentation for the latest version of Next Admin. If you are using an older version (`<5.0.0`), please refer to the [documentation](/v4/docs)
</Callout>

To configure your models, you can use the `model` property of the [NextAdmin options](/docs/api/options) parameter.

This property allows you to configure everything about how your models, their fields, their relations are displayed and edited.

Example for a schema with a `User`, `Post` and `Category` model:

```tsx copy
import { NextAdminOptions } from "@premieroctet/next-admin";

export const options: NextAdminOptions = {
  /* Your other options here */
  model: {
    User: {
      toString: (user) => `${user.name} (${user.email})`,
      title: "Users",
      icon: "UsersIcon",
      list: {
        display: ["id", "name", "email", "posts", "role", "birthDate"],
        search: ["name", "email"],
        filters: [
          {
            name: "is Admin",
            active: false,
            value: {
              role: {
                equals: "ADMIN",
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      edit: {
        display: [
          "id",
          "name",
          "email",
          "posts",
          "role",
          "birthDate",
          "avatar",
        ],
      },
    },
    Post: {
      toString: (post) => `${post.title}`,
    },
    Category: {
      title: "Categories",
      icon: "InboxStackIcon",
      toString: (category) => `${category.name}`,
      list: {
        display: ["name", "posts"],
      },
      edit: {
        display: ["name", "posts"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

It takes as **key** a model name of your schema as **value** an object to configure it.

By default, if no models are defined, they will all be displayed in the admin. If you want more control, you have to define each model individually as empty objects or with the following properties:

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    {
      name: "toString",
      description:
        "a function that is used to display your record in related list",
      defaultValue: "id field",
    },
    {
      name: "aliases",
      description:
        "an object containing the aliases of the model fields as keys, and the field name",
    },
    {
      name: "title",
      description:
        "a string used to display the model name in the sidebar and in the section title",
      defaultValue: "Model name",

    },
    {

    },
    {

      name: "permissions",
      description: "an array to specify restricted permissions on model",

      ),
    },

      name: "row",
      type: "Object",
      description: "The current row of the list view",
    },

## Notice

The edit page's form can display notice alerts. To do so, you can pass objects in the `display` array of the `edit` property of a model.
This can be useful to display alerts or information to the user when editing a record.
This object takes the following properties :

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "String",
      description: "The title of the notice. This is mandatory",
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "String",
      description: (
        <>
          A unique identifier for the notice that can be used to style it with
          the <code>styles</code> property. This is mandatory
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      type: "String",
      description: "The description of the notice. This is optional",
    },
  ]}
/>

Here is a quick example of usage.

Considering you have a model `User` with the following configuration:

```typescript filename=".../options.ts" copy {13-17}
export const options: NextAdminOptions = {
  basePath: "/admin",
  title: "⚡️ My Admin",
  model: {
    User: {
      /**
        ...some configuration 
      **/
      edit: {
        display: [
          "id",
          "name",
          {
            title: "Email is mandatory",
            id: "email-notice",
            description: "You must add an email from now on",
          } as const,
          "email",
          "posts",
          "role",
          "birthDate",
          "avatar",
          "metadata",
        ],
        /** ... some configuration */
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In this example, the `email-notice` notice will be displayed in the form before the `email` field.
