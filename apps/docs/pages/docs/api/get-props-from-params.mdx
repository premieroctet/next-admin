`getPropsFromParams` is a function that returns the props for the [`NextAdmin`](/docs/api/next-admin-component) component. It accepts one argument which is an object with the following properties:

- `params`: the array of route params retrieved from the [optional catch-all segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments)
- `searchParams`: the query params [retrieved from the page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional)
- `options`: the [options](#next-admin-options) object
- `schema`: the json schema generated by the `prisma generate` command
- `prisma`: your Prisma client instance
- `action`: the [server action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) used to submit the form. It should be your own action, that wraps the `submitForm` action imported from `@premieroctet/next-admin/dist/actions`.
- `deleteAction`: the [server action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) used to delete one or more records in a resource. It is optional, and should be your own action. This action takes 3 parameters: `model` (the model name) and `ids` (an array of ids to delete). Next Admin provides a default action for deletion, that you can call in your own action. Check the example app for more details.
- `getMessages`: a function with no parameters that returns translation messages. It is used to translate the default messages of the library. See [i18n](/docs/i18n) for more details.
- `searchPaginatedResourceAction`: the [server action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) used to search for resources in a selector widget. This is mandatory for App Router, and will be ignored on page router. Just like `action`, it should be your own action that wraps `searchPaginatedResource` imported from `@premieroctet/next-admin/dist/actions`.
