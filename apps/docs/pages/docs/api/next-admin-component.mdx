# `<NextAdmin/>` component  
<Callout type="info">
  This is the documentation for the latest version of Next Admin. If you are using an older version (`<5.0.0`), please refer to the [documentation](/v4/docs)
</Callout>

`<NextAdmin />` is a React component that contains the entire UI of Next Admin. It can take several props from `getNextAdminProps` function, but also some additional props:

- `options` used to customize the UI, like field formatters for example. Do not use with App router (see [Options](/docs/api/options) for more details).
- `dashboard` used to customize the rendered dashboard. 
- `user` used to add some user information at the bottom of the menu. See [user properties](/docs/api/options) for more details.

This is an example using the `NextAdmin` component with a custom Dashboard component and options:

```tsx
import Dashboard from "path/to/CustomDashboard";

export default function Admin(props: AdminComponentProps) {
  /* Props are passed from getNextAdminProps function */
  return (
    <NextAdmin
      {...props}
      dashboard={Dashboard}
      user={{
        data: {
          name: "John Doe",
        },
        logout: "/api/auth/logout",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
