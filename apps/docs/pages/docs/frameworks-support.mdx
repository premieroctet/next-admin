# Frameworks support

Historically, Next-Admin was made to provide exclusive support for Next.js. The v8 release decoupled the library for any direct Next.js dependency and allowed support for any full-stack framework, as long as it can support API routes.

Next-Admin provides adapters for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start), which simply consists on providing a routing hook that matches a given interface. So it is in fact easy to override the behavior of how routing works if the provided ones does not fit your needs.

The built-in adapters are accessible through the following import :

```ts
import { NextAdminRouterAdapter } from '@premieroctet/next-admin/adapters/<your-framework>'
```

## Building your own adapter

An adapter consists of a context that will need to wrap the `NextAdmin` component. This context provides a hook that matches `RouterInterface`.

```ts
type Query = Record<string, string | string[] | number | null>;

type PushParams = {
  pathname: string;
  query?: Query;
};

type Router = {
  push: (params: PushParams) => void;
  replace: (params: PushParams) => void;
  refresh: () => void;
  setQuery: (query: Query, merge?: boolean) => void;
};

type RouterInterface = {
  router: Router;
  query: Record<string, string>;
  pathname: string;
};
```

Once you created your hook, you can use the `createRouterAdapter` function to create the context.

```ts
import { createRouterAdapter } from "@premieroctet/next-admin/adapters/context";
import type { RouterInterface } from '@premieroctet/next-admin/adapters/types'

const useMyRouterHook = (): RouterInterface => {
  // My router
}

export const MyCustomNextAdminRouterAdapter = createRouterAdapter(useMyRouterHook)
```

You can now use `MyCustomNextAdminRouterAdapter` to wrap the `NextAdmin` component.
