There is two ways to translate these default keys, provide a function named `getMessages` inside the options or provide `translations` props to `NextAdmin` component.

> Note that the function way allows you to provide an object with a multiple level structure to translate the keys, while the `translations` props only allows you to provide a flat object (`form.widgets.file_upload.delete` ex.)

You can also pass your own set of translations. For example you can set a custom action name as a translation key, which will then be translated by the lib.

```js
actions: [
  {
    title: "actions.user.email",
    action: async (...args) => {
      "use server";
      const { submitEmail } = await import("./actions/nextadmin");
      await submitEmail(...args);
    },
    successMessage: "actions.user.email.success",
    errorMessage: "actions.user.email.error",
  },
],
```

Here, the `actions.user.email` key will be translated by the lib, and the value will be used as the action title, aswell as the success and error messages after the action's execution.

Currently, you can only translate the following:

- action title, success and error message
- field validation error message

Check the example app for more details on the usage.

## Translate model name and fields

By using the `model` key in the translations object, you can translate the model name and fields.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "User": {
      // Keep the case sensitive name of the model
      "name": "User",
      "plural": "Users",
      "fields": {
        "email": "Email",
        "password": "Password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note that if you only use one language for your admin, you should prefer to use the `alias` system ([more details](/docs/api-docs#model)) to customize field names.
