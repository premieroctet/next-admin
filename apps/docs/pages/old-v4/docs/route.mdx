# Customize the admin route name

<Callout type="default">
  This documentation covers an older version of Next Admin. If you are using the
  latest version (`>=5.0.0` and above), please refer to the [current
  documentation](/docs/route).
</Callout>

When setting up `next-admin` you can set the admin panel route name to whatever you want.
The admin panel route name is set by your folder name.

Examples:

`pages/admin/[[...nextadmin]].tsx` will be `/admin`

`pages/prisma/[[...nextadmin]].tsx` will be `/prisma`
